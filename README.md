## Build Instructions

### 1. Build the EXE (with PyInstaller)

Make sure you have all dependencies installed:

```sh
# ...existing code...
```

Then run:

```sh
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon assets/eyes.ico --add-data "assets;assets" main.py
```

- This will bundle the assets folder and use your icon from `assets/eyes.ico`.
- The output EXE will be in the `dist/` folder.

If you want to include other files (like `word_memory.json`):

```sh
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon assets/eyes.ico --add-data "assets;assets" --add-data "word_memory.json;." main.py
```

### 2. Test the EXE

- Run `dist/main.exe` and make sure all features and images work.

### 3. Build the Installer (Inno Setup)

- Open `Eyetype4YouInstaller.iss` in Inno Setup Compiler.
- Make sure the `[Files]` section includes:

```ini
Source: "dist\main.exe"; DestDir: "{app}"
Source: "assets\*"; DestDir: "{app}\assets"; Flags: recursesubdirs
Source: "word_memory.json"; DestDir: "{app}"
```

- Set the icon for the installer and shortcut:

```ini
[Icons]
Name: "{group}\Eyetype4You"; Filename: "{app}\main.exe"; IconFilename: "{app}\assets\eyes.ico"
```

- Compile the installer.

## Notes

- If you add new assets, update the `--add-data` argument.
- If you change the EXE name, update the installer script accordingly.
- For advanced PyInstaller options, consider using a `.spec` file.
